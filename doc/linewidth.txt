INSTALLATION				*linewidth-installation*

You can use your favourite installation method. With Tim Pope's pathogen
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) it is simply a question of cloning the
linewidth.vim repository into your vim bundle directory.
>
	cd ~/.vim/bundle
	git clone git://github.com/heindsight/linewidth.vim
<

==============================================================================
COMMANDS				*linewidth-commands*

:LinewidthHighlight			*:LinewidthHighlight*
	Toggle highlighting of lines that are too long. Any text between
	virtual column |g:linewidth_warn_width| (default: 72) and virtual
	column |g:linewidth_error_width| (default: 79) is highlighted using
	the |LineWidthWarning| highlight group. Any text after virtual column
	|g:linewidth_error_width| is highlighted using the |LineWidthError|
	highlight group.

==============================================================================
CUSTOMISING				*linewidth-customising*

					*LineWidthWarning* *LineWidthError*
LineWidthWarning
LineWidthError
	By default, the LineWidthWarning and LineWidthError highlight groups
	are linked to the standard Todo and Error groups respectively (see
	|group-name|). The |:highlight| command can be used to customize
	highlighting. For example:
>
		highlight LineWidthWarning ctermfg=black ctermbg=Yellow
		highlight LineWidthError ctermfg=White ctermbg=Red
<

					*g:linewidth_warn_width*
					*g:linewidth_error_width*
g:linewidth_warn_width	number (default 72)
g:linewidth_error_width	number (default 79)
	The line-lengths at which highlighting is applied can be customised
	by setting the variables "g:linewidth_warn_width" and
	"g:linewidth_error_width". Eg:
>
		let g:linewidth_warn_width = 95
		let g:linewidth_error_width = 100
<
	Note: Changing the values of these variables will not take effect
	immediately if highlighting is active. Line width highlighting needs
	to be turned off and on again for new values to take effect.
